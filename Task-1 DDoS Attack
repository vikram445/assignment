1. Explain the following types of DDoS attacks?
Explain the cause, effect, and mitigation for these attacks:
a. CC (Challenge Collapsar) attack.
b. SYN Flood attack.
c. SSL Attack Note:
Format of the answer should be divided into 4 sections as follows:
● Cause: (To explain What is the cause of attack)
● Identify: (To explain How will you identify this attack.)
● Effect: (To explain What is the effect of this attack.)
● Mitigation: (To explain How will you mitigate this.) 



Answer----

a. CC (Challenge Collapsar) attack 

Cause: cc attack targets the application layer by sending high number of HTTP GET or      POST request to exhasust the server resources. 

Identify: it can be identified by unusual search in challenge response traffic and a significant increase in server resource utilisation without a proportional increase in legitimate user activity.

effect: the server become overwell leading to degraded performance slow response time and potential down time for legitimate user. 

mitigation: implement rate limiting use CAPTCHAs to differentiate between boards and humans and deploy web application firewall to filter malicious traffic.
